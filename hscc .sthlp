{bf:hscc} {hline 2} Heterogeneous-Slope SCC estimator with joint partial pooling,
optional common time fixed effects, and HC3-adjusted Driscoll-Kraay inference

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:hscc} estimates a heterogeneous-slope panel model in which unit-specific
slopes are decomposed into a central slope, systematic heterogeneity related to
unit-level regressor means, and residual unit-specific slope deviations.

{pstd}
The residual slope deviations are jointly estimated under a quadratic penalty
derived from the estimated residual slope covariance matrix. The final
covariance matrix uses HC3-adjusted observation scores aggregated across units
by time and a Bartlett Driscoll-Kraay HAC estimator.

{pstd}
Version 1.0.2 adds the optional {cmd:timefe} specification. When requested,
common time effects are partialled out from the complete joint HSCC design.
These time effects are treated as common nuisance components and are kept
outside the heterogeneous-slope and penalty blocks.

{pstd}
The data must be {cmd:xtset} before estimation. Version 1.0.2 requires a
strongly balanced estimation sample.


{title:Model}

{pstd}
The slope structure is

{p 8 8 2}
beta_i = beta + Gamma z_i + eta_i,

{pstd}
where beta is the central/average slope vector, z_i contains centered unit
means of the regressors, and eta_i is residual slope heterogeneity subject to

{p 8 8 2}
sum_i eta_i = 0.

{pstd}
The joint estimator minimizes the within-transformed residual sum of squares
plus a quadratic penalty on eta_i.

{pstd}
With {cmd:timefe}, the empirical specification additionally controls for
common additive time effects,

{p 8 8 2}
y_it = alpha_i + lambda_t + x_it'beta_i + u_it,

{pstd}
where lambda_t denotes the common time effect. The time effects are partialled
out using an FWL-equivalent transformation and are not treated as heterogeneous
slope parameters.


{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt lag(#)} sets the maximum Bartlett HAC lag. If omitted, {cmd:hscc} uses

{p 12 12 2}
floor(4*(T/100)^(2/9))

{pstd}
with a minimum of 1.

{phang}
{opt timefe} adds common time fixed effects by partialling them out from the
complete joint HSCC design. Time effects are treated as common nuisance
components and are kept outside the heterogeneous-slope and penalty blocks.

{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
The methodological contribution of HSCC is in the point-estimation layer.
Driscoll-Kraay / SCC is retained as the inference framework.

{pstd}
The version 1.0.2 covariance is a first-order HC3-DK approximation. Monte Carlo
validation for the motivating N=31, T=20 design indicated mild small-T
undercoverage. Results close to conventional significance thresholds should
therefore be interpreted with appropriate caution.

{pstd}
The {cmd:timefe} option is an extension of the empirical specification rather
than a separate estimator.

{pstd}
The estimator is not tuned to preserve statistical significance.
