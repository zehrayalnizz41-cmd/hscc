Changelog
1.0.2 — 2026-09-28
- Added optional common time fixed effects via the timefe option.
- Time effects are partialled out from the joint HSCC design using an FWL-equivalent transformation.
- Time effects are treated as common nuisance parameters and are kept outside the heterogeneous-slope blocks.
- Retained the frozen HSCC-JOINT point-estimator architecture.
- Retained HC3-adjusted Driscoll–Kraay / SCC inference.
- Added reporting of time fixed-effects status in the estimation output.
- Added recovery and storage of centered common time effects in e(timefe_b).
- Fixed the display routine so recovered common time effects are read from e(timefe_b) rather than the temporary Mata/Stata matrix name.
- No change was made to the HSCC point estimator, penalty structure, or HC3-DK inference.
1.0.1 — 2026-09-27
- Added descriptive HSCC within R-squared (e(r2_w)).
- Retained frozen HSCC-JOINT point-estimator architecture.
- Retained HC3-adjusted Driscoll–Kraay / SCC inference.
- Added fixed-N, large-T theoretical documentation.
- Added validation and reproducibility documentation.
1.0.0 — 2026-09-27
- Initial Stata command.
- Joint partial-pooling heterogeneous-slope estimator.
- Systematic + residual slope heterogeneity.
- PSD-corrected residual slope covariance.
- HC3-DK covariance.
